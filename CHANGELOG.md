# Changelog

## Unreleased

## v1.1.6 - 2026-09-25

- SoundCloud sign-in now happens in your own browser instead of a Ryotunes window: pressing Connect opens soundcloud.com (captchas and Google/Facebook/Apple popups work there), and the daemon watches your browser's cookie stores — Firefox-family and Chromium-family profiles, default browser first — importing the session the moment it appears and proving the token against `/me` before saving it. Already signed in in the browser? One click imports it instantly, no browser round trip. Cookie stores are only re-read when their file actually changes, and an unfinished sign-in ends with a clear message after five minutes rather than hanging.

- Installing an update from Settings now restarts Ryotunes by itself: after the package lands, a detached helper waits for the old daemon to release its socket lock, then relaunches — socket-activating the new daemon and opening the new client — instead of leaving "quit and reopen" as the user's chore. If the helper fails, the app stays open with the old manual guidance as the fallback.

## v1.1.5 - 2026-09-25

## v1.1.4 - 2026-09-24

- Fixed "Download playlist / Download album" always failing (albums: "missing field `video_id`", playlists: "missing field `videoId`"): two stacked bugs — the client mapped an album/playlist's rows into batch entries twice, dropping every track id, and the daemon's batch endpoint read its JSON in snake_case while the client posts camelCase. Single-track downloads were unaffected, which is why only albums and playlists broke.
- Album and playlist downloads now read as one collection: the queue and history group every batch under a single card showing the album/playlist cover, kind, aggregate progress and how many tracks are saved, waiting, failed or cancelled — expandable to its per-track rows. Batch tracks also land in a folder named after their collection on disk, and re-downloading still dedups against them wherever they sit.
- Added Settings ▸ Diagnostics: one rolling record of everything that went wrong, for both halves of the app. The daemon logs its own warnings and errors, every failed request, and panics to a ring buffer and a rotating file (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/dev.ryoku.ryotunes/logs/ryotunesd.log`); the client forwards the failures it sees (rejected actions, lost connections, error toasts), buffering them while the daemon is down and delivering them on reconnect. The page filters by level, source and text, copies the whole list to the clipboard, and opens the log folder — so "songs won't play" finally has evidence to show instead of a guess.
- Settings ▸ Storage's cache action is now a one-click playback repair: "Force clear caches" drops every layer that can wedge stream resolution — cached stream URLs and lyrics, mpv's on-disk audio bytes, the stored PoToken, the per-video WEB_REMIX failure blacklist — and rotates the anonymous YouTube playback identity (`visitorData`) on the spot, which is the manual fix for "Couldn't load this track — YouTube rejected the stream link". If the identity re-fetch fails (offline), the toast says so; the token is still dropped, so the next launch or a bot-gated resolve re-bootstraps it. Changing stream quality keeps clearing only the URL cache and no longer rotates the identity.

## v1.1.1 - 2026-09-24

- Added SoundCloud sign-in: a Ryotunes window opens the site's own sign-in (account or Google/Facebook/Apple), captures the session's OAuth token from the webview's cookie jar, proves it against `/me` before saving it, and keeps it alive through SoundCloud's rotating refresh. Signing in is optional — SoundCloud still browses and plays as a guest — but a signed-in account adds its own playlists, liked tracks and followed artists to Home, and the token survives restarts (an expired one says so instead of silently vanishing).
- Home is now the merged feed: YouTube Music's shelves remain the spine (the default source, signed in or not), and every signed-in provider contributes its own shelves to the same page — Spotify's made-for-you rows when a Premium session exists, SoundCloud's personal rows when connected. Cards navigate and play across providers exactly as before; one provider being down never blanks the page.

## v1.1.0 - 2026-09-24

- Fixed some users being unable to play any YouTube track ("Skipped (unavailable)" on everything): YouTube's anonymous playback clients now require a valid `visitorData`, and a failed first fetch used to leave the daemon without one for its whole life, so every stream request hit Google's bot gate. The startup bootstrap retries with backoff, and a resolve that is rejected by the bot gate now fetches a fresh `visitorData` on the spot and retries once.
- Fixed Spotify Premium users seeing "sign in" on every launch and every track skipped as "not available": the cached session is announced to clients once it restores (it used to finish silently after the UI snapshot, leaving the gate up), the sign-in gate explains a genuinely dead session instead of demanding a fresh login, a dead librespot session is detected and (once per credential lifetime) recovered from saved credentials before a track is reported as needing sign-in, a Spotify queue that needs sign-in now stops with the real reason instead of toast-storming "Skipped (unavailable)", and the Spotify device identity is persisted per installation instead of re-randomising on every launch.
- Added Download playlist to the playlist page menu: albums and playlists batch-download through one daemon call that gathers every continuation page and admits the whole collection against a single dedup pass.
- Downloaded tracks are now smart-deduplicated: re-downloading a collection (or a single track) skips audio already in the download folder even when it lives there under a different upload's id or a ` (N)` collision name, matching on the normalized "artist title" as well as the exact filename.

## v1.0.8 - 2026-09-20

- Stopped Now Playing stuttering while the window is resized or scaled: the cover size read the column's assigned width and the body's assigned height, feeding layout outputs back into the children's preferred sizes, so the column re-polished itself on every pass. The cover now sizes from the root and the header's implicit height, which are layout inputs.

- Fixed every page rendering blank under Ryoku's Reduce motion: the page-stack enter animation used render-thread Animators, which never apply their end value at duration 0, so the stack was stranded at opacity 0. The end state now lands directly when there is no animation to run.

## v1.0.6 - 2026-09-08

- Fixed app-launcher activation after removing and reinstalling Ryotunes: removal now stops the user units before deleting them, and a fresh install repairs stale socket state left by older packages. Ordinary upgrades still leave playback and self-update RPCs running.
- Presented Ryotunes consistently as Ryoku's main music app in pacman, the app launcher, and software catalogues.

## v1.0.5 - 2026-09-08

- Fixed Home snapping back to the top when a continuation page arrived: new shelves now append to a persistent Qt list model instead of replacing the model.
- Made the Linux launcher native-QML-only, including cold starts and missing sockets. Removed the legacy Tauri overrides and duplicate desktop entry; Quickshell is now a required package dependency.

## v1.0.4 - 2026-09-08
- Prevented automatic QML reload during package upgrades, which could reload `shell.qml` while pacman temporarily removed it. Quit and reopen after installation to load the new client and daemon together.
- Fixed the primary QML Home page jumping past its header on the first scroll. Asynchronous header growth stays pinned only until the user starts scrolling.
- Home now puts a compact resume control and remembered listening context ahead of discovery. Played songs, albums and playlists persist across launches without counting a restored queue as a new listen.
- Added searchable Home shortcuts from recents, the library and provider search, plus YouTube playlist-link previews. Duplicate/capacity feedback and a bounded scrolling list keep the controls usable in small windows.
- Added a bounded, on-device Home discovery ranker using the existing provider feed, listening recency, artist affinity and diversity. No additional recommendation service, model training or idle polling is introduced.

## v1.0.3 - 2026-09-08

## v1.0.2 - 2026-09-08

## v1.0.1 - 2026-09-08

## v1.0.0 - 2026-09-08

- **Fresh v1 releases on every default-branch push.** The app, daemon, CLI, native client and package start at `1.0.0`. CI queues pushes, builds each exact source, and advances `1.0.9 → 1.1.0` (major fixed at 1). Releases include generated notes, binary/source archives and SHA-256 sidecars. A permanent pacman `epoch=1` makes v1 packages an upgrade from legacy v2 installations without changing the release asset filenames. Package hooks no longer restart the daemon during the transaction.
- **About credits and standalone updates.** Both clients credit ashmitvoid and neur0map and link LiMusic upstream. About shows current/available versions, checks GitHub on request, opens the changelog and installs verified official Arch packages with administrator approval, independently of a full Ryoku update. After installation, fully Quit and reopen Ryotunes to reload the client and daemon.
- **Releases ship a prebuilt Arch package.** Each release builds `ryotunes-<version>-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst` (and its `.sha256`) with an unprivileged `makepkg` in an Arch container from that release's exact source and attaches it to the GitHub release beside the reproducible source tarball, so `pacman -U` — and Ryoku's `update`/`doctor`, which read GitHub releases directly — no longer wait on a downstream rebuild. `scripts/build-arch-package.sh` reproduces the asset locally (`docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" -w /src archlinux:latest scripts/build-arch-package.sh`). The old `ryotunes-release` repository_dispatch into Ryoku Arch is removed.
- Release checks now validate synchronized manifest versions and shipped capability policy rather than pinning UI copy, comments, or implementation source text; version bumps no longer rewrite the check script.
- Added **Download album** to the native album menu: queues the complete album rather than filtered rows, follows continuation pages, reuses download preferences and bounded workers, and reports unavailable tracks or partial admission errors.
- **One-click music downloads in the native client.** A download control beside the heart saves the current track immediately; Downloads in the sidebar shows progress, waiting tracks and persistent history with cancel, retry and open-folder actions. Settings › Downloads adds the destination, Original/MP3/Opus formats, artist folders, embedded cover art & lyrics, and a safe 1–4 worker limit (default 1). Workers survive window closure, never overwrite existing files, and are terminated/reaped on quit; interrupted jobs remain retryable. YouTube and public SoundCloud use their source links; Spotify uses a clearly labelled YouTube search match. Downloads embed available cover art and plain lyrics where supported and save matching image and synced `.lrc` or plain `.txt` companion files. Local lyrics take precedence over network lookups for offline playback. Metadata lookups send track details to external providers; missing matches produce non-fatal history notes.
- **Device playlists get automatic artwork.** A local playlist's card and page now build a cover from its own songs: four distinct song covers become a 2x2 collage, one to three collapse to the first cover, an empty playlist shows none. A custom cover you pick still wins everywhere, and removing it (Reset) drops straight back to the automatic art without a round-trip to YouTube Music. Cards, the page header and the sidebar refresh the instant tracks are added or removed or a cover changes.
- Fixed native-client reconnection when the daemon was absent on the initial connection attempt, so download state and playback resynchronize without reopening the client.
- Join the mpv event reader before destroying its native handle, preventing a shutdown race exposed by download metadata enrichment.
- **Ryotunes v2 Discord presence.** The Rich Presence card is rebuilt around the v2 identity: the track's album art is the hero image with a small Ryotunes badge overlaid (**Ryotunes v2** on hover), and when a track has no shareable art (local files, missing thumbnails) the Ryotunes brand mark stands in rather than the underlying Discord application's icon. Hovering the art now shows the album and the service it is playing from, and the "listen" button is routed by provider — YouTube Music watch pages and Spotify `open.spotify.com` track pages, with SoundCloud (numeric-id only) and local/radio tracks left linkless rather than pointing somewhere wrong. The default "Listening to" title is now **Ryotunes v2**; a custom title you set is still kept. (The Discord application registration itself is still the upstream one — changing the name and icon Discord shows in its own app registry needs a Ryotunes-owned Application ID, which is pending.)

## v2.5.1 - 2026-09-06

- **The heart saves without an account.** Liking a track when there is no YouTube Music session (or on a SoundCloud/local track) lands it in a device-local **Liked Songs** playlist that Library › Songs shows and the library lists; unliking removes it, the heart and the now-playing snapshot reflect it at once. Signed in, YouTube's own rating is used as before.

## v2.5.0 - 2026-09-06

- Releases are one command: `scripts/release.sh patch|minor|major --push` bumps every manifest, rolls this changelog, tags; the `Release` workflow verifies the tagged tree builds (binaries, web UI, skins, tests), publishes the GitHub release with a reproducible source tarball + sha256, and tells Ryoku Arch, whose own workflow bumps the `[ryoku]` package and publishes it. The package enables `ryotunesd.socket` for every user (preset + install hook), which is what made a fresh install open the old Tauri app before.

- Power: the cover wash no longer drifts every frame (the client sat at ~35 % of a core while playing; now ~1.6 %). Pause-to-quit: a minute into a pause with the main window off screen the client exits, and the daemon's idle grace is now 60 s (was 5 min), so a paused, closed Ryotunes is fully out of memory about two minutes after the pause; socket activation brings it back on the next launch, media key or MPRIS call. Signing out drops the account's recents (Liked Music, library playlists) from Home's Jump back in.

- Seven expressive shipped skins beside Paper/Ember/Mist - **Neon**, **Vapor**, **Phosphor**, **Arcade**, **Broadsheet**, **Concrete**, **Velvet** - each with its own bundled OFL faces (Unbounded, Playfair, Major Mono, Press Start, Bebas Neue, Cormorant…), radii, motion and wash. Every display title now takes the skin's face (three surfaces still read Ryoku's). `RYOTUNES_SKIN_MODE` pins a mode for previews so light-first skins render light.

- Skins are RyoStore products: the store's new `ryotunes-skins` category installs into `~/.local/share/ryoku/ryotunes-skins/<id>/`, which Ryotunes reads as the STORE source (after user skins, before shipped) and watches, so an install shows up in the picker without a reload; *Settings › Appearance › Get more skins* opens the store on the category; `ryotunes-cli skin use <id|system>` selects a skin from a shell. The catalogue ships 20 skins derived from Ryoku's colour schemes.

- **Skins.** One source for every colour, face, radius and duration: `system` (the Ryoku desktop, live), `matugen` (a skin written by a matugen template from the wallpaper; on Ryoku one of the Theme apps), or any `skin.json` folder under `~/.config/ryotunes/skins/` or `/usr/share/ryotunes/skins/` (shipped: paper, ember, mist). Live reload while editing, a picker + fork + folder buttons in Settings › Appearance, `ryotunes-cli skin check|list|show`, a JSON schema, `docs/SKINS.md` and `skins/README.md` for contributors, `scripts/dev/skin-preview.sh` for the 800x500 previews. Decor gains a "Skin default" level.

- **SoundCloud** is the third provider, no account needed (`crates/soundcloud`, api-v2 with a scraped `client_id`, HLS AAC 160k straight into mpv). Search, artists, albums/playlists, Discover Home (Trending by genre, Curated, Artists to watch), related-track autoplay, and SoundCloud's own per-track **waveform** as the seek bar in the player bar, the Home card and the Now Playing stage. SoundCloud artist pages take the Orange/SoundCloud shape: banner, avatar, followers, tracks left, "Albums from this user" right.
- Now Playing stage re-laid: header row with the Collapse pill, top-aligned art + title column, one foot band (waveform or spectrum); the glow box is gone.
- Spotify stays Premium-only (librespot); the sign-in gate now says why a sign-in failed.

- Client visual pass to the old design's proportions (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-05-eye-candy-spacing-pass.md`): Home hero with the Now Playing card, faded chip row, `// Section` headings, Shortcuts / Jump back in / Familiar artists panel; sidebar brand card, numbered groups, playlists with `+ New playlist`; queue rows that keep their titles readable; Now Playing stage with a `Collapse` pill. The stage was stuck open: the player bar's expand button now toggles it and Escape closes it.

- Added the native Ryotunes client: `ryotunesd`, a Tauri-free daemon (playback, Innertube, library, MPRIS, tray, Last.fm, Discord, Listen Together, socket-activated via `ryotunesd.socket`, exits five minutes after the last subscriber leaves with nothing playing), `ryotunes-cli`, and a pure-QML client run by Quickshell (`ryotunes-qml`, installed at `/usr/share/ryotunes/client`) that reproduces the Svelte UI (Home, Search, Library, Playlist, Album, Artist, List, Radio, Settings, Queue, Lyrics, Now Playing, Listen Together, mini player, command palette) with the Ryoku theme singletons. The native client is the default: `ryotunes` asks the daemon to show (socket activation starts it after a boot), which raises the connected client or opens `ryotunes-qml`; the Tauri app runs only on `ryotunes --tauri` or where no daemon socket exists. Measured on a Ryzen 7940HS laptop: paused idle 0.1% CPU (Tauri: 2% plus three WebKit processes), playing idle 0.7% + 2.1%, Home scroll 0.8% (Tauri: 60% WebKit + 16% host).
- Fixed reopening the native client after Super+Q: the daemon's `show` event was not handled by the client at all, and Quickshell leaves a compositor-closed `FloatingWindow` at `visible: true`, so the window never came back until the process was killed. The client now handles `show` and remaps the window.
- Rebuilt the native client on one visual system (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-05-native-client-visual-design.md`): Sonora's three-column frame (title bar, 248 px rail, content, a persistent 340 px Queue / Lyrics panel, an 88 px player bar with the transport centred on the window) in Ryoku's flat-paper, hairline, bone-plate language; one type scale (Fraunces titles, Space Grotesk body, tracked mono labels); page heroes and table-style track lists; the playing cover as the room's light (a static blurred backdrop that cross-fades on track change and drifts only while playing) and its sampled accent on playback state only; the Now Playing stage with a spectrum ribbon fed by cava while visible and playing; snapshot-blurred modals. Passive motion is gated on playing, not reduce-motion and not power-saver.
- Restored the compact player as the Tauri widget's 724 x 356 geometry: a layer-shell surface with the widget as a draggable item inside it (the previous surface-dragging approach fed its own deltas back), above windows, position remembered.
- Added Sound: tempo, pitch, reverb, bass and stereo width on the daemon's mpv filter chain (`set_audio_fx` / `get_audio_fx`, `audio-fx` event) with presets (Slowed + Reverb, Nightcore, Bass Boost, Wide) from the player bar and Settings.
- Added `crates/spotify`, a Spotify provider lifted from nolight132/sonora (GPL-3.0-or-later): OAuth sign-in, Pathfinder / protobuf metadata, collection, playlists, colour-lyrics, and streaming through librespot's pipe sink into a FIFO mpv plays raw, so every mpv feature (the Sound chain, MPRIS) applies to Spotify audio. The title bar's provider switch lights the window red for YouTube Music and green for Spotify (a tweened glow, the page re-entering on a switch); daemon routing behind it is the next step, and YouTube Music is unchanged.
- Extracted `crates/core` (innertube clients, player, state, library, integrations) out of `src-tauri`; the Tauri host is now command forwarders over `ryotunes_core`.
- Fixed the Arch package build under makepkg's `lto` option (`options=(!lto)`): the vendored sqlite and ring C objects cannot be linked by lld when compiled with `-flto`.
- Fixed the timeline freezing for the rest of a session after a seek-thumb drag released outside the window: WebKitGTK delivered neither `change` nor `pointerup`, so the locally held drag value shadowed every later position tick (reproduced by dragging past the window's bottom edge; MPRIS kept ticking, the bar did not). Both seek sliders now commit the pending drag on pointer release, capture loss, window blur, the first buttonless pointer move, or a track change.
- Removed the scroll-time `ryo-is-scrolling` class toggle: rules keyed on it reached every image and every promoted artwork layer, so each wheel notch cost a whole-page style recalculation plus compositing-layer churn, twice. Scrolling stays paint-bound in WebKitGTK (about 60% of a core while scrolling on a 2560x1600 panel, unchanged), which the native client work addresses.
- Added `RYOTUNES_WEBKIT_FEATURES=Name=1,...` to flip WebKitGTK feature flags (for example `CompositingBordersVisible`, `CompositingRepaintCountersVisible`) when profiling the renderer.
- Brought the release gate back to green on a clean checkout: the reveal-failsafe invariant matched the old 1500 ms, the private-path scan tripped on a git worktree's `.git` file, and two files had drifted from rustfmt.

## v2.4.1 — 2026-09-02

- Isolated the remote Google login and hidden cipher/PoToken JavaScript WebViews from all Ryotunes application commands using Tauri's runtime-authority AppManifest and an explicit main/mini-only command permission.
- Replaced broad bundled `core:default` exposure with only the app/event and explicit window/WebView permissions the UI needs.
- Hardened native filesystem boundaries: file choices stay behind Rust pickers, watched music folders are not recursively asset-visible, forged local-track ids are rejected, and portable playlists cannot contain local/radio identifiers.
- Hardened Internet Radio with official mirror filtering, bounded directory responses, opaque native station resolution, persisted-record revalidation and rejection of local/private/reserved/IP-mapped stream addresses.
- Hardened renderer-controlled settings, proxies, external URLs, Google login navigation and Listen Together endpoint validation.
- Bounded Listen Together WebSocket frames/messages, room state, queue/suggestion counts and per-client outbound queues.
- Restored the default Discord Rich Presence title to **Ryotunes** while preserving custom local vanity text.
- Added weekly dependency monitoring/security audits and release invariants for the new trust boundaries.
- Preserved native libmpv playback, WebKit hibernation, MPRIS/tray lifecycle, five-minute idle exit and event-driven performance behavior.

## v2.3 — 2026-08-27

- Fixed Ryoku/Hyprland cold-launch geometry by adding compositor-owned `size = { 1760, 1000 }` to the exact-title managed window rule.
- Polished the Home listening-console controls so Play/Pause and Queue have a balanced gap above the lower divider.
- Expanded Light mode into a richer parchment/sage/blue-grey/clay/gold palette with clearer surface separation and no new continuous visual effects.\n- Added event-driven Ryoku theme parity: Follow System now mirrors the same named/wallpaper Material roles as Ryoku.Ui Tokens, updates main + mini immediately through inotify/Tauri events, and primes the palette before window reveal.
- Preserved v2.2 audio-only native playback, background WebKit hibernation, MPRIS/tray lifecycle, stable Home DOM, mini-player behavior and event-driven performance architecture.



### FINAL R3 visibility hotfix
- Fixed a Linux hidden-window deadlock where the main WebView started with `visible:false` but its reveal handshake was queued behind `requestAnimationFrame`; WebKitGTK can suspend rAF for hidden toplevels, leaving Ryotunes running only in the tray even after repeated launches.
- The mounted Svelte tree now sends readiness immediately, with bounded timer retries.
- Added a native reveal deadline for cold start, reconstructed main windows, and second-launch recovery so a lost frontend readiness message cannot leave the application permanently invisible.
- Added release invariants guarding against reintroducing rAF-gated hidden-window readiness and requiring the native recovery path.

## v2.2 — 2026-08-27

- Promoted Ryotunes to the final Ryoku-shell user release candidate.
- Raised default floating main-window fallback to 1760×1000 logical and adaptive mapped geometry to ~92% × 84% of monitor work area.
- Changed untouched/fresh UI scale default and Ctrl+0 reset from 120% to 110%, while retaining persisted custom values.
- Redesigned mini-player spacing and icon-led Now/Lyrics/Queue navigation; fixed compact active-lyric clipping and stale manual-scroll restoration.
- Lowered Light/Follow-System-Light luminance and strengthened surface hierarchy.
- Removed pointer seek focus rectangles while keeping keyboard seek focus legible.
- Added breathing room around bottom-player and Home listening-console transport controls.
- Stopped Settings/header divider lines before the close-control zone.
- Kept v2.1 R3 cold-start/reopen native reveal failsafes, Search pagination, Home stable-DOM behavior, background WebKit hibernation and native Quit/MPRIS teardown.

## v2.1 — 2026-08-27

- Fixed first-launch visibility with one native frontend-ready handshake shared by cold start and reconstructed WebViews.
- Fixed mini-player expand-to-main race by retaining the mini surface until the full UI is actually visible.
- Replaced transient Hyprland map-rule injection as the primary policy with a Ryoku-style persistent `hl.window_rule`; adaptive work-area geometry stays native and hidden before reveal.
- Added real bounded Search continuation through Innertube/Tauri/UI for mixed, song, album, artist and playlist result streams; removed practical first-page ceilings.
- Isolated Search nested scrolling so touchpad/wheel gestures cannot chain into the background page.
- Redesigned the mini-player visual shell and segmented PLAYING/LYRICS/QUEUE navigation; removed action menus only from mini queue rows.
- Added mini-safe keyboard transport handling and kept one central full-app shortcut registry.
- Reworked Light mode to a warm layered stone palette rather than bright white surfaces.
- Preserved audio-only playback, background WebKit hibernation, five-minute tray idle shutdown, explicit Quit teardown, stable Home DOM and bounded artwork/cache paths.


## v2.0 — 2026-08-26

- Canonicalized the frozen v2.0 Cargo.lock from the target-machine Cargo diff: removed stale `httpdate` and `tauri-plugin-window-state` lock entries and the stale `hyper -> httpdate` edge. The builder now requires `cargo fetch --locked` to accept the shipped lockfile directly and never performs an unlocked refresh.
- Fixed native `pnpm check` blockers found during the first target-machine build: keyed-each `animate:flip` structure in Edit Home, module/instance `BrowseItem` import collision in Search, listbox option focus semantics, and deprecated Svelte module-script syntax.
- Added complete compact Now Playing/Lyrics/Queue mini-player views using shared queue/lyrics state.
- Added bounded decode-before-swap artwork preparation shared by large Now Playing and mini-player artwork.
- Replaced the full-Search eight-result snapshot with a bounded scrollable/incremental result workspace and richer selected-result detail panel.
- Centralized track context actions across visible ⋯, pointer context click and keyboard context invocation; ⋯ actions are now visible at idle.
- Introduced one Home/Edit Home section registry, central video-shelf rejection and central seed-artist heading normalization to `You might also like`.
- Made session-cached Home stable on revisit instead of silently revalidating visible page-one shelves while scrolling.
- Added stable Tauri GTK/Wayland app id plus pre-map Hyprland float/89%×84%/center rules and retained native geometry fallback.
- Unified cold-start and Linux tray-reopen hidden-until-frontend-ready reveal behavior to avoid blank WebKit frames.
- Reworked Light mode into layered page/card/panel/sidebar/player tokens and standardized shared dialog close geometry.
- Preserved audio-only playback, event-driven transport, background WebKit hibernation, five-minute tray idle exit, Low Resource Mode and deterministic explicit Quit.
- Rebuilt release invariants, `/proc/<pid>/exe` diagnostics and zero-touch `ryotunes-v2.0 2.0.0-1` replacement packaging.

## v1.9 — 2026-08-26

- Adaptive centered Ryoku/Hyprland floating window (~89% × 84% of monitor work area) with no stale maximized/fullscreen restore.
- Restored and redesigned the 640×200 Ryoku-style mini-player; its boot surface can no longer cover the compact UI.
- Faster perceived cold start/reopen by showing the themed shell first and deferring optional visitor, local-library, Listen Together, cipher and search-prewarm work.
- Search suggestion/full-search consistency: reliable All Results handoff, recent-search structure and standard track actions.
- Familiar Artists top-track actions, clear `More like <artist>` headings and audio-only filtering of video shelves/results.
- Darker muted Light theme, safer live Ryoku accents, long-title clipping and seek/focus styling fixes.
- Queue drag commit/settle refinement, Queue/Lyrics state retention, shelf navigation and large-playlist filtering.
- Discord `Listening to Music` branding/backoff/logging cleanup and authoritative Linux autostart synchronization.
- Preserved five-minute tray-only no-playback exit, deterministic explicit Quit and Low Resource/background-WebKit architecture.
- Robust process diagnostics and zero-touch Ryoku replacement packaging with newest-available stock-backup migration.

## v1.7 R4 — 2026-08-26

- Hardened explicit Quit into one authoritative shutdown path: stop mpv, clear/drop MPRIS, close Discord presence, leave Listen Together with a bounded timeout, then exit.
- Kept paused background playback resumable from Ryoku QS/MPRIS; Pause no longer means an idle/empty session.
- Closing the mini player now closes only the mini surface instead of rebuilding the full application.
- Added Follow system / Light / Dark appearance modes with a warm, low-glare light palette and Ryoku accent integration.
- Made Discord Rich Presence report Disabled / Connecting / Connected / Unavailable and react immediately to its toggle.
- Expanded Low Resource mode into native transport cadence and Home/network policy while preserving playback quality.
- Coalesced queue reorder pointer work to animation frames, kept the dragged row normal-sized and refined insertion/edge-scroll feedback.
- Improved Listen Together form readability, modal close geometry and transport-button focus treatment.
- Deferred optional cipher/network prewarm off the cold-start critical path and shortened UI reconstruction safety delays.
- Removed eager Home continuation crawling/community enrichment, bounded Familiar Artists loading and retained v1.6 WebKit hibernation/stable Home containment.

## v1.7 R2/R3 stabilization — 2026-08-26

- Fixed background pause lifecycle: paused loaded tracks remain resumable through tray/QS/MPRIS instead of triggering process exit.
- Removed eager Home continuation crawling and community search enrichment that could cause intermittent visible-idle CPU spikes.
- Made Familiar Artists demand-proximate with bounded two-at-a-time loading and reduced hero decode size.
- Slowed fallback Ryoku palette polling while retaining immediate focus/visibility refresh.
- Added managed Ryoku replacement packaging so the public launcher is singular while `ryoku-desktop` itself remains installed and recoverable.

## v1.6 — 2026-08-26

- Added Linux main-WebKit hibernation during background playback and automatic idle process shutdown when no UI/audio remains.
- Restored stable R4 Home layout; removed the v1.5 mount/unmount virtualization that caused scrolling bounce and renderer churn.
- Reduced background transport cadence and removed healthy-path transport-watchdog wakeups.
- Tightened browse/artwork/speculative-work budgets without destroying and recreating Home sections.
- Refined pointer queue reordering with insertion gaps, edge auto-scroll and click suppression.
- Fixed Lyrics footer/source/timing controls clipping at short and floating window heights.
- Preserved R4 account-menu, artist-artwork, playback-progress, scrollbar and low-cost visualizer fixes.

## v1.4 — 2026-08-25

- Maintenance release 2: removed the permanent frontend transport clock, made PoToken helpers demand-driven, tightened helper teardown, reduced artwork-accent work and simplified touchpad fallback ownership.
- Fixed account popover overlap at titlebar scaling and Familiar Artists hero artwork flicker.
- Fixed lyric auto-follow scrollbar flashing and horizontal overflow.
- Added smooth playback-position rendering with stale-event recovery from mpv.
- Removed the Home back-to-top overlay.
- Restored a lightweight playback-state visualizer without a JavaScript analyser loop.
- Renamed the public release line to v1.4 and cleaned release/package metadata.

## V23 — 2026-08-25

- Unified playlist metadata grid, deterministic/failure-safe playlist heroes and smart-playlist identities.
- Unified ranked local search and refined Add Shortcut/Queue/list search surfaces.
- Settings Keybinds reference driven from the live shortcut registry.
- App-wide non-document selection behaviour with editable fields preserved.
- Memory pass: smaller bounded caches, smaller decoded artwork requests and open-only heavy overlays.
- Preserves V22 audio-only/native playback, low-resource mode, touchpad and responsive-layout behaviour.

## V22 — 2026-08-25

- Added Low resource mode, queue search and Stop after current.
- Added Recently Played / Rediscover smart playlists and on-demand Listening Insights.
- Added per-track lyric timing correction plus low-cost next-track lyric prefetch.
- Added portable playlist JSON import/export and optional Quickshell/MPRIS widget.
- Preserved V21 responsive/touchpad/audio-only fixes and tightened resource invariants.

## V21 Final — 2026-08-25

- Fixed Home search suggestion clipping/stacking, shallow-window layout and visible mood-chip scrollbar.
- Restored native two-finger touchpad ownership; the WebKit fallback now intervenes only if native pixel scrolling does not move.
- Replaced the ambiguous interlocking Open Link glyph with one authored external-link mark.
- Rebuilt the seek rail as a static SVG waveform + straight remainder while preserving native click/drag/keyboard seeking.
- Reduced playback render wakeups: word-synced lyrics are bounded to 30 Hz, active-line lookup is binary, deep Home shelves use content visibility and the last regular-playback backdrop blur is gone.
- Backported authoritative Like-state refresh and private-upload stream validation fix.
- Added artwork accent caching/prewarming and targeted blurred-artwork compositor promotion.
- Added consistent contextual menus to Home tiles.
- Kept the application strictly audio-only.


## 20.0.0 — 2026-08-24

V20 is the release-candidate cleanup pass. It keeps the recovered V18/V19 Now Playing geometry frozen, adds global peel-by-peel Escape navigation toward Home, synchronizes Lyrics Focus with the global transient-state stack, and removes obsolete version-scoped release wiring. The seven V19 craft fixes remain intact.

## 19.0.0 — 2026-08-24

V19 is a focused craft/stability release: the recovered Now Playing geometry is frozen while seven interaction and rendering defects are corrected.

- Preserve square audio artwork without stretching.
- Remove the dead Lyrics/Lyrics Focus right-hand lane.
- Play Quick Results songs directly on row click.
- Replace the malformed Open Link toolbar glyph with stable chain geometry.
- Escape returns Search/Library to Home after transient surfaces close.
- Remove filled hover background from dialog close buttons.

## 18.0.0 — 2026-08-24

V18 is the restoration release: it keeps the V17 reliability work, but replaces the unstable V17 Now Playing geometry with an isolated layout derived from the proven V14/Ryowalls composition.

### Now Playing restoration

- Rebuilt Now Playing with isolated V18 classes so legacy V17 layout overrides cannot fight its geometry.
- Restored the V14/Ryowalls-style 5/12 media + 7/12 Queue/Lyrics split on wide desktops.
- Bounded audio artwork to a calm square media plate and gave music video its own contained 16:9 surface.
- Preserved the current playback/video-sync logic while removing the layout paths that produced giant artwork, dead gutters, page leakage and unstable queue widths.
- Queue and Lyrics share one stable detail lane; Lyrics Focus is a dedicated single-lane focus mode.
- Collapsed and expanded sidebar states keep the same Now Playing composition.
- At narrow desktop widths the media preview yields to the detail lane instead of overflowing the viewport.

### Ryoku interface hardening

- Left-aligned Settings with the rest of sidebar navigation.
- Kept the native Hugeicons Open Link glyph rather than the malformed custom chain mark.
- Preserved the corrected bone-on-ink Play/Pause hover/active treatment.
- Preserved aspect-aware Ryoku editorial art for Search, Library, Data & Storage and About.
- Preserved the redundant-sidebar-search removal, refined Search workspace and authenticated Library artwork path.
- Preserved V15-style atmospheric line motion with reduced-motion support.

### Reliability retained from V17

- centralized queue/lyrics ownership;
- route scroll restoration;
- duplicate playback-request protection and resolving state;
- Home first-paint deferral for non-critical enrichment;
- WebKitGTK video paint-containment fix;
- unified overlay stage and route recovery UI;
- current-line recovery for manually scrolled lyrics.

### Release gate

Run `scripts/release-check.sh`, then `pnpm check`, `pnpm build`, `cargo check --workspace`, `cargo test --workspace`, and `cargo tauri build --no-bundle` on the target Ryoku/Arch machine. Finish with a real visual regression pass covering Home, Search, Library, Settings, Now Playing audio/video, Queue, Lyrics and sidebar collapse/expand.

## Build hotfix

- Restored the typed `showMenu` and `contextMenu` TrackRow props used by compact QueueList/mini-player menu suppression. This fixes the v2.1 FINAL `svelte-check` failure reported during the native build gate.
