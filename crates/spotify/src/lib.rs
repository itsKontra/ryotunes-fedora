//! Ryotunes Spotify provider.
//!
//! Lifted from nolight132/sonora (`crates/music/src/spotify`, GPL-3.0-or-later), commit 695242e,
//! and rewired for Ryotunes. See `README.md` for provenance, the `SongItem` mapping, and the
//! daemon-wiring notes.
//!
//! Boundary: this crate knows nothing about GPUI, Tauri, mpv, or UI state. Metadata comes from
//! librespot's session (Pathfinder GraphQL + protobuf extended-metadata + the collection v2 API).
//! Audio reaches Ryotunes' single libmpv engine through librespot-playback's `pipe` backend written
//! to a per-session FIFO that mpv opens as raw S16LE / 44100 Hz / stereo — never cpal or rodio.
